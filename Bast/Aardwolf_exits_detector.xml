<description trim="y">

This is a support plugin meant for other plugin authors. 

This detects parts of the mud associated with movement. These
include current exits, current room title. It also detects 
the inability to move. 

Example of use

-- detect room or exit changes
function OnPluginBroadcast( msg, id, name, text )

  if ( id == "18c24130ab326dc05b49420d" ) then
      if ( msg == 2 ) then
         exits_change()
      end
      if ( msg == 1 ) then
         room_change()
      end
      if ( msg == 3 ) then 
         cant_move()
      end
  end
end
  
-- get the room name
local var = GetPluginVariableList(  "18c24130ab326dc05b49420d" )
var.roomname

-- get the exits
loadstring( var.exits )()
current_exits = exits


Exits are stored as a table with valid exit directions as keys. 
Value 1 indicates an exit, Value 2 indicates a closed exit.

-- TODO 

-- Want to move this away from being an exitts detector toward a generic room detector. 
-- Should also detect roomobjs and roomcharss as well, I think. 

-- This is fairly hard, as exits come in beffore the roomobjs and chars. So, we
-- dont know when we may have found them.

-- My solution to this is

-- detect title. As this comes first, we knoow that all other info is out of date,
-- so empty the other variables at this poinnt. 

-- detect room objs and room chars. This is  a straightforward multiline detection thing. 

-- detect the next change of stats. This shoould come from the next prompt.
-- broadcast room complete at this point. Doo not signal this at any other time. 

-- This all makes the assumption that we gett room title, exits, objs (maybe),
-- chars (maybe) and then stats. If this is  true, then when stats come in, we can make a 
-- decisions about what is present in the rooom, with knowledge of everything.
